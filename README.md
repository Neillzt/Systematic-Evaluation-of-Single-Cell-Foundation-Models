# Systematic-Evaluation-of-Single-Cell-Foundation-Models

## Overview

This study System evaluate three state-of-the-art single-cell foundation models—**scGPT**, **GeneFormer**, and **scFoundation**—on cell type classification tasks. We evaluated the models using five datasets: **Myeloid**, **human Pancreas**, and **Multiple Sclerosis**, **Covid-19**, **Lung-Kim** under both standard fine-tuning and few-shot learning scenarios.

## Key Findings

- **scFoundation** consistently outperforms the other models.
- **GeneFormer** often underperforms, sometimes yielding results worse than baseline models.
- **scFoundation** demonstrates strong generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, a capability lacking in baseline models.

## Significance

Our work highlights the potential of foundation models for addressing complex biomedical challenges, especially in scenarios where models are trained on one population but deployed on another.
