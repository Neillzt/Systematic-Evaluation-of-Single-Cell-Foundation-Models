## Scripts for Testing

Two separate scripts are provided for testing **Linear Regression** and **XGBoost** models:

1. **Linear Regression**: Requires the `sklearn` library.
2. **XGBoost**: Requires the `xgboost` library.

### Prerequisites

Please ensure the following libraries are installed before running the scripts:

- **scikit-learn**: For Linear Regression.
- **xgboost**: For XGBoost.

The data processing method is different from the basic model, please refer to the respective scripts

You can install these libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn xgboost
